    introduction:
      'Shunfa Bakery is a Chinese bakery right by Brooklyn’s Chinatown. The family-owned business started in 2015 and has become the neighborhood’s go-to eatery for Chinese pastries and dishes. It is best known for its steamed rice-rolls that start as low as $1.50. All food is made from scratch and all dishes are made to order. The bakery also offers a variety of drinks from the usual milk tea offered at many Chinese eateries to smoothies and bubble tea. It’s a great stop to grab a quick bite to eat or a whole meal!',
